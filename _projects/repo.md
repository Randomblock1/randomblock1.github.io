The jailbreak repo is based om [Silica](hytps://github.com/shugabuga/silica), a free open-source repository template.

The repo doesn't host much right now, but it currently has a beta version of KernBypass (advanced jailbreak detection bypass software), Neofetch (tool to display system info), and Jailbreak Status Bar Icons (which spices up your status bar with some icons).
