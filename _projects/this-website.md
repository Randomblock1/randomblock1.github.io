This website uses [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).
It's an awesome theme for Jekyll.

Jekyll is software that generates HTML from simple and configurable Markdown files.
Sounds complicated? It's not. It's like generating a full website from a few text files, which is what it is.

Markdown text files let you do things like make text from simple things.

`[clickable link](https://example.com)` will make this:

[clickable link](https://example.com)

This makes posting things on here really easy and simple.
No more messing with complicated HTML and CSS! Just use Jekyll and some text.

Anyway, that's really all I have to say about this. Take a look around the website to see what I've done!
