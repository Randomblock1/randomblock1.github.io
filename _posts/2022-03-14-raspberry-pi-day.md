and how it made me a (future) CS student

It's Pi Day. 3/14/22. Today I am not only celebrating the gloriousness of circles, but also pies. No, not the apple pie my local grocery store sells for $3.14, but Raspberry Pi.

When I was a kid in grade school, my dad got me a Raspberry Pi. This was, frankly, a *horrible* decision on his part, because now instead of reading 2 high-school level books a week, I was now fiddling around with a computer. Well, maybe it wasn't a *horrible* decision, because I learned how to code. Now, mind you, it was just Scratch, and I was mostly playing/modifying the games, not making them. But... that's still programming! It's just not very advanced. But for a kid my age? I may as well be a genius.

*(I'm sure they wish I still read. Haha too bad computer go beep boop)*

Eventually, I actually learned to code. I don't mean I just put some blocks together and made a game. Yes, I did that, but that was only the beginning. I learned about exponents and square roots by playing around with those blocks, well before the curriculum taught me. I learned about what programming really is. I learned to think like a computer: how to solve a problem one tiny instruction at a time.

Later on, this evolved into me trying to learn Python. Emphasis on trying. My dad bought me a book and some components. I made a motion-activated camera with Python, but I didn't really understand it. And I put it on the back burner. Back to Scratch.

Then the Raspberry Pi 2 comes out. I still wanted to learn Python, and I was now old enough to understand a little more. But again, no clue what was going on, [I'd rather make a game where I blow up a cat.](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/26714238) Then the Pi 3 came out, and I understood more. I just used the Pi to play retro video games and stream YouTube to the TV (this was before every TV was a smart TV). Deep down I wanted to seriously learn Python, but it seemed like an insurmountable task. How do I know what library to import, what function to call, how do I even format it? What would I even program? A game? Where do I start?

Then the Pi 4 came out.

And it changed everything.

I was old enough and had enough experience to take a serious shot at learning to code. The Pi 4 was considerably faster than its predecessors. And there were more online learning resources than ever. I could install more, do more, try, fail, and try again more. Iteration after iteration, commit after commit, I learned. And I didn't let up. I began with shell scripts to automate stuff, and moved on to Python for more versatility. I used Docker to host a Minecraft server; I made my Pi a NAS. If I wanted to code on the go, I simply SSH'd into it from my phone.

Eventually, I joined my high school's robotics club. All that knowledge came in handy. We programmed with blocks, just like Scratch. But it was more complex, and as I made the robot run around, picking up yellow blocks, I realized this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.

Without the original Raspberry Pi, the cheap but effective general computer, I would not be where I am today. It sparked something in my heart, a passion for learning to code. I learned to code for _fun_, and no other reason. Of course, it just so happens that [CS majors get paid quite handsomely](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/50-highest-paying-college-majors/) ðŸ˜„.

In 2021, I set out to learn Node.js, and [I've done that.](https://github.com/Randomblock1/wg-auto-web) This year, I'm learning Kotlin and Go. When I go to college, I'll have to learn C++ (not gonna lie, kinda dreading it, Go seems much friendlier) but even if it's hard I'll do it.

Without Pi, none of this would have happened. I'd be at a loss for what I actually wanted to do. Sure, I was good at math and science, but is that really what I wanted to do for the rest of my life? No. I wanted to learn computer science. I wanted to program, and I would have never discovered this passion without Pi.

So thank you, Raspberry Pi. For everything. For a cheap and affordable computer that anyone can buy. For a computer that can do anything, and I mean anything. For a computer that was meant to be be toyed with and learned with, and for the endless tutorials that came freely with it. 

Thank you.

*The Afterword*

I read [an interview with the Raspberry Pi CEO.](https://www.theverge.com/22966155/raspberry-pi-ceo-interview-eben-upton-computer-chip-shortage-diy) He said his goal was to make more people interested in learning computer science. If you're reading this: you have succeeded. That is mainly what prompted this blog post.
